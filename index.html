<p>In November 2013, Todd Park was <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/fabx5f858nhcmuf/parksupoena.pdf">subpoenaed</a> by Congressman Darrell Issa to testify in front of Congress about whether or not Healthcare.gov was prepared on launch day. Instead of continuing to fix Healthcare.gov (a mess he did not make), Mr. Park had to spend his hours preparing for his testimony.  On October 28, 2014, Congressman Lamar Smith issued another <a href="http://science.house.gov/press-release/smith-issues-subpoena-uncover-white-house-s-role-faulty-healthcaregov-security">subpoena</a> to Todd to testify again about his oversight of healthcare.gov.</p>

<p>In his career as White House <abbr title="Chief Technology Officer">CTO<abbr>, Park created and launched the first <a href="http://www.hhs.gov/open/initiatives/hdi/">Health Data Initiative</a>, supported and promoted the  <a href="http://www.healthit.gov/patients-families/blue-button/about-blue-button">Blue Button Initiative</a>, and created the <a href="http://wh.gov/innovationfellows">Presidential Innovation Fellowship</a>, a program that's brought innovators and private sector thinking to government and <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2013/05/15/rfp-ez-delivers-savings-taxpayers-new-opportunities-small-business">saved taxpayers</a> millions of dollars.  And, on October 1st, 2013, Todd Park&rsquo;s role changed as he was brought into an all-hands-on-deck effort under Jeff Zients to help get healthcare.gov on track. This effort was ultimately successful, as millions of Americans were able to purchase health insurance through the exchange.</p>

<p>The difference in the amount of technical talent that the federal government had available to it before Todd, compared to today, is night and day.  There is now an army of extremely talented people in federal government that are there because of him. Organizations like <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2014/08/11/delivering-customer-focused-government-through-smarter-it"><abbr title="United States Digital Service">USDS</abbr></a> and <a href="http://18f.gsa.gov/"><abbr>18F</abbr></a> are just part of this fundamental change. Todd <a href="http://spectrum.ieee.org/view-from-the-valley/at-work/tech-careers/white-house-cto-todd-park-to-become-silicon-valley-recruiterinchief">continues to serve his country</a> to recruit tech talent to help improve the way our government serves — and secures —  our citizens.</p>

<p>Mr. Park is a true public servant, who cares about making government more effective and accountable, just like our Congressmen. We hope that they can work together on solving the policies that enabled healthcare.gov to fail in the first place, just as they have toward passage of Congressman Issa&rsquo;s bill, the <a href="http://legislation.nextgov.com">Federal IT Acquisition Reform Act</a>. The House Science Committee should be applauded for its strong interest in ensuring that the Affordable Care Act&rsquo;s most visible aspect (healthcare.gov) works securely and efficiently for all Americans.</p>

<p>No matter what side of the aisle you sit on, Todd is one of the good guys. Stand with Todd. <a href=https://twitter.com/search?q=%2standwithtodd&f=realtime>#standwithtodd</a></p>
